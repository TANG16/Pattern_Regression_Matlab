# Pattern_Regression_Matlab
Matlab code for support vector regression (SVR) and revelance vector regression (RVR) analysis with cross validation to evaluate the prediction power.

Revelance vector Regression (RVR) is implemented using PRoNTo (http://www.mlnl.cs.ucl.ac.uk/pronto/).  
The function prt_rvr.m and prt_machine_rvr.m are functions of this software.  
Support vector regression (SVR) is implemented using LIBSVM (https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvm/).
